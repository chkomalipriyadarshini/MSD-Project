The Plagiarism and Quality Checker for Assignments is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.
It enables students to upload assignments in formats such as .docx, .pdf, or .txt, and automatically evaluates the content for originality, grammar quality, and AI-generated patterns.

The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and basic AI-based content scoring algorithms to provide detailed feedback on each uploaded file.
It helps students improve their work ethically by detecting potential plagiarism or low-quality writing before submission.
